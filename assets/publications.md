## Our Recent Highlights

### Running Stability
Professional runners achieve high efficiency at the cost of weak stability. Is running of professional runners more "stable" than that of novices? Not exactly.
[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34707)

### Dynamic Stability Assessment
People use mathematical techniques to assess stability of various dynamical processes, including human motion and economy. However, current measurements are vulnerable to noise, which inevitably exists in the real world. We developed a novel mathematical technique that enables more accurate and noise-robust assessment of dynamic stability.

### Jump Enhancement
Barely detectable vibration applied to soles can enhance your jump height.

### Long-term Motion Effects
Humans typically move in a way that is comfortable in the short term but harmful in the long term. Because the deleterious effects of such comfortable but unsafe motion develop slowly, people do not perceive the risk in time as in the case of disc degeneration. We can resolve this.

### Movement Intention Detection
Detecting the intention of human movement requires multiple sensors. We reduced the number of required sensors dramatically… to …ONE.

### Body Composition Estimation
Body compositions like muscle mass and fat mass are important indicators of health, but measuring them requires expensive devices like DXA or MRI. We propose a much easier way to estimate them.
[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.11.027)

### Trip Prevention
Large variability of toe clearance during walking increases the risk of tripping. Applying small but barely detectable vibration to soles can reduce this risk.
[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261732)

### Device Reliability
The fact that some devices are widely used does not guarantee that they are reliable or accurate. We need to quantify their reliability & accuracy, and suggest better ways.

### Aging and Athletic Performance
As we become older, both our strength and endurance decrease no matter how much we exercise. How and when will our motor ability begin to alter? We found the critical age when our athletic performance is likely to change.

### Treadmill vs Over-ground Exercise
When we walk or run on a treadmill, it feels so different from our over-ground exercise. Why so?
[DOI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49272-0)

### Fatigue and Balance
When we experience fatigue, we cannot balance well and may even fall. How can we mitigate this with undetectable vibration.
