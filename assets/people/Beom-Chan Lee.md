## Description

Prof. Lee’s research program is focused on advancing neuro-biomechanical and rehabilitation engineering to improve mobility, balance, and overall quality of life for individuals with neurological and age-related impairments. To date, he have led significant projects across four primary areas: (1) the development of an innovative real-time adaptive propulsion enhancement system that integrates visual biofeedback to improve gait performance in stroke survivors, (2) the creation of a fall-inducing technology platform that informs fall prevention and gait training, (3) the design and assessment of wearable and robot-assisted rehabilitation systems to address balance and gait dysfunctions, and (4) the identification of neuro-biomechanical markers associated with aging, neurological impairments, and movement disorders. 

Key highlights of his research include 44 articles published in peer-reviewed journals, 28 papers presented and published at international conferences, and 47 abstracts presented globally. My work is regularly published in top-tier journals (e.g., IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, Journal of Neuroscience, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Gait and Posture, etc.), and he have delivered over 40 invited lectures worldwide. My efforts have been supported by competitive grants from NIH and national/international research agencies, including the American Parkinson’s Disease Association and the National Research Foundation of Korea. 

Beyond research, Prof. Lee dedicated to mentorship and collaborative teaching, having guided undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career researchers in developing translational skills essential for impactful research. Through interdisciplinary collaborations and close engagement with healthcare professionals, patients, and community stakeholders, Prof. Lee strive to translate our research findings into actionable interventions that enhance the health and mobility of diverse populations.
