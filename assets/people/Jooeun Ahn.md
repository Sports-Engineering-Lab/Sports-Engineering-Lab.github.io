We have an instrumented treadmill, force platforms, multiple high-speed motion capture cameras, EMG sensors, a wearable metabolic system, etc. However, the most valuable assets to our lab are the students. They are the 'Avengers' in the field of sports engineering, who have strong passion and expertise in either kinesiology, engineering or both.
